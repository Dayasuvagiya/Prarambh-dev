## Colors

The Pet Service website incorporates a color scheme that evokes a sense of tranquility, freshness, and trust. I have chosen the following colors and their respective color codes:

- White (#fafafa)
- Green (#008000)
- Black (#000000)
- Light Green (#dbf1da)

### Fonts
- The primary font, [Poppins], [Loto] was chosen because it is standard, plain and informative but not too rigid. It looks friendly and conversational but holds a seriousness. It is also sans-serif, making it very easily readable throughout different color schemes and complementary to the font used for Headings.
- The secondary font, [sans-serif] was chosen because it is thin, elegant and refined yet it has flair.

### Icons
- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
- As they are utilised as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs in the same tag. I often used Bootstrap classes to style them uniformly.
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social account icons and the on the service section.
