## Colors

The Pet Service website incorporates a color scheme that evokes a sense of tranquility, freshness, and trust. I have chosen the following colors and their respective color codes:

- White (#fafafa)
- Green (#008000)
- Black (#000000)
- Light Green (#dbf1da)

### Green Theme Color: 
#### Symbolism: 
I used Green color for theme because Green is commonly associated with nature, health, and vitality, which aligns well with the pet care industry. It symbolizes freshness, harmony, and a connection to the outdoors, reflecting my commitment to providing a nurturing and natural environment for pets.

### Black & White Font:
#### Classic and Timeless: 
For me black and white font color creates a classic and timeless aesthetic. This color combination is often associated with elegance, simplicity, and professionalism. It presents a clean and sophisticated appearance, reflecting the professionalism and reliability.

#### Versatility and Focus:
Using black and white for the font allows other design elements, such as images or green accents, to stand out and grab attention. It keeps the focus on the content and ensures that important information is easily readable, without distractions.

## Fonts
- The primary font, [Poppins], [Loto] was chosen because it is standard, plain and informative but not too rigid. It looks friendly and conversational but holds a seriousness. It is also sans-serif, making it very easily readable throughout different color schemes and complementary to the font used for Headings.
- The secondary font, [sans-serif] was chosen because it is thin, elegant and refined yet it has flair.

## Icons

  </div>
  
- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
- As they are utilised as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs in the same tag. I often used Bootstrap classes to style them uniformly.
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social media account icons such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube.

I tested the site personally on my Android device to ensure its functionality, responsiveness, and compatibility across different devices and browsers. The following testing procedures were conducted:

#### Validation

- CSS has been validated with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)to ensure adherence to industry standards.

#### General Testing
- Each time a feature was added, all the functions were tested to see if there was an impact.
- Forms have validation and will not submit without the proper information.
- External links open in a new tab.

- Compatibility testing across popular web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- The site was developed on a Chromebook and, as such, the majority of testing occurred on Chrome.

## Bugs
The error message encountered while checking my HTML code on W3C's validator, stating "Attribute 'aria-label' not allowed on element 'a' at this point," is a result of the validator's strict adherence to HTML standards and syntax rules.

In this case, I used the 'aria-label' attribute on an 'a' element (anchor tag) to provide accessibility support by describing the purpose or meaning of an icon, even though the element itself does not contain any visible text. While an intention to enhance accessibility is commendable, according to the HTML specification, the 'aria-label' attribute is not allowed on 'a' elements that lack textual content.

To address this issue and adhere to the HTML standards, have a an option:
I can add Textual Content: Consider adding some descriptive text alongside the icon within the 'a' element. This text can provide a clear and concise explanation of the icon's functionality, ensuring both visual and non-visual users understand its purpose.
